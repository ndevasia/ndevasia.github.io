                                <p> The platform GenAI was intended to be an online textbook with several chapters about different AI topics, such as neural networks, conversational agents, and robotics, among several others. The chapter we decided to prototype with was the one about generative adversarial networks (GANs) due to the project lead's personal interest in them. </p>

                                <p> A great deal of time was spent on the interaction design of the website itself, and keeping both the landing pages and the learning material itself as easy to navigate as possible for learners and users of all ages and levels. For example, we determined that while the color scheme and design should remain the same throughout the website, the "feel" (font, UI) should change between content levels. </p>

                                <p> We also wanted to make AI seem approachable, not futuristic, dark, chrome colored, or hacker-y. We considered naturalistic themes and light colors in opposition to the typical depiction of AI in media.</p>

                                <p> At the beginning of the project, I worked along with another student in charge of web design to wireframe out the look and feel of the website. I went through several of the educational websites that I used on a daily basis and tried to pick out the elements that I found the most natural and usable, and then combine these into a design. The web designer took my fairly simple ideas and gave them a great deal of color. </p>

                                <p>Halfway through the project, however, the web designer got too busy, and I was left with coming up with the visual design elements of the website as well. In accordance with our naturalistic ideas for representing AI, I chose a color palette, designed a v1 logo, and created a moodboard. </p>

                                <p>I was also assigned to write the beginner and intermediate levels of a GANs textbook chapter. This was the first time that I had to think deeply about what it meant to be a learner at each of these levels, and be mindful to use appropriate terminology and complexity. Similarly, we designed the visuals to "level up" as well. </p>

                                <p> This project taught me a great deal about designing UI and thinking very deeply about my user. Though I had never dabbled in visual design before, I enjoyed the chance to determine how the site looked and felt, skills that proved extremely useful to designing this website!</p>

                                <p>Creating this website was where I really honed my HTML and CSS skills, and learned how to run Javascript for interactivity as well. It's also the site that I'm the most emotionally attached, having committed 100+ times to the repo; my grad student and I were reluctant to let it be externally managed. </p>

                                <p>On their own, these websites were fairly small projects in the scope of things. However, tooling away on them gave me a much better feel for web dev and UI design that is coming in useful for this portfolio website in particular. The increase in my HTML/CSS skills has been, frankly, astronomical compared to where I started from. I used to find it insufferably frustrating, but now, working on these websites induces a sense of comfort and satisfaction in me similar to doing my laundry or cleaning my room. That feels like a huge improvement.

                                <p>Like many triple A game studios, Santa Monica Studio utilizes a custom built engine for God of War. As such, the tool for tweaking settings within said engine was also custom designed, and was over a decade old when I was tasked with creating a more modern prototype.</p>

                                <p>I was tasked with using the <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">Dear ImGui</a> library to create this prototype. ImGui is an open source C++ library for creating user interfaces, primarily for game engines and other real-time 3D applications.</p>

                                <p>This was my first time working with a codebase on a massive scale. I learned how to parse through huge chunks of relatively undocumented code, and gained an intuition for how to look for the code actually relevant to my needs. I had also never worked with an external library as big as ImGui, so figuring out how to integrate it into the existing PlayStation codebase was a slow task.</p>

                                <p>I also learned what it was like to have multiple stakeholders for a system. Designers, artists, and programmers all used the engine debugging tool in different ways, and had different opinions on the changes that should be made to it. From the way the PS4 controller was used to navigate the menu, to the actual widgets used for certain features themselves, I learned the importance of taking multiple voices into account when creating an end product for a variety of users.</p>

                                <p>The biggest challenge I faced was struggling through the nuances of C++. I learned that low-level programming is definitely not my forte, and the intricacies of buffer overflows and overwritten caches did not bring me much joy. But in the end, the experience of working in a triple A studio on such a huge project was worth all the frustration. As a small contributor, I'm excited for the world to see God of War: Ragnarok, and as a fan of the franchise, I'm dying to play it myself!</p>

                                <p> An important feature for AR games, which happen both in real locations and in real-time - is time! When I joined the TaleBlazer project, some of the most highly requested features from users were time-based event blocks, in which a user could trigger an event using elapsed time. My task was to brainstorm, prototype, and implement the best set of blocks for users to achieve this functionality.</p>

                                <p>I began with brainstorming a variety of time-based features that could come in handy in a location-based AR game:</p>

                                <p>I then created paper prototypes and iterated upon them multiple times before finally moving on to implementation. The TaleBlazer backend is written in Javascript on top of a CakePHP backend. I primarily wrote Javascript in Android Studio, and built countless iterations of the app onto an old Android phone. The final result was that these three blocks were added to the TaleBlazer programming language:</p>

                                <p> My project for TaleBlazer was, in itself, relatively simple. However, this summer was absolutely instrumental to my growth as an engineer for several other reasons. I learned how to use Git, and managed, committed to, and pull requested branches with my chcanges. I learned the process of prototyping and adding user requested features, and learned how to go through several iterations of ideation. I learned how to adjust to different development environments, and code in languages that I had never encountered before. For all of these reasons, my summer at TaleBlazer will likely remain the most formative summer of my career.</p>

With my blog posts, I contributed to a small amount of those pageviews with a variety of different types of blog posts: <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/doors-of-east-campus/">compilations</a> of <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the-november-rule/">MIT</a> <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/murals-of-east-campus/">culture</a>, several <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/an-unnecessarily-long-post-on-how-much-i-like-spotify/">enthusiastic</a> <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/bloggers-wrapped-2019/">posts</a> about <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/blogger-wrapped-2020/">Spotify</a>, and some <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/a-comprehensive-guide-to-crying-on-campus/">minorly viral</a> <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/a-comprehensive-guide-to-vending-machines-at-mit/">data</a> <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/a-comprehensive-guide-to-my-favorite-places-on-campus/">visualizations</a>. Compiling most of these posts helped me develop what I now consider to be a life skill: shamelessly asking large groups of people to provide me with similarly large amounts of data. At some point, I even had a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/beaverconfessions/posts/2194647610604274?__xts__[0]=68.ARBmpCcfUtAE3ugcuPxOYmMTh3MmjsHZZ5smzAmslB3NS7rHrEq8j0hqII7d49QhnPu56rAI4SAVaZEsUltCjjcy0l40ty4z6zouKdzUScjI-s-SVaKQyejF7tKQYJrruxUNZxmbCXyfRKuJZAUML5_r1MwxPxWrEHTeboQrSwQdQlmEU63md1bjC3LD0R9w1DTjoii8352QdrzM81OoNQGfY85DDW-MlDoFZ8sBHkAvAdQ2Bpv4va8veasF_sebs5Grs6QaDAr43D4v220gWYVkAyHYFYa_tjcUxZTXW1M1zjGlRromscXwvXrolExYBsuO6HneYF-kI5GH5SndFA">salty MIT Confessions post</a> written about just <i>how</i> shameless I was. However, I firmly believe that these experiences built character, and will serve me well in the working world. When I need to get something done, I'll get it done.</p>

                                <p>I had never written for such a large audience before, and it was both strange and gratifying to receive comments and emails from incoming students telling me how much my blogs resonated with them on different levels. Being told that my blogs were the reason that a student applied to MIT certainly ranks among the more touching experiences in my life. In the grand scheme of things, the impact of my blogs on the internet was quite small, but if they could change even a few people's life trajectories, then I think my quest as a writer has been fulfilled. </p>

                                <p>My interest in video games led me to take nearly all of the gaming adjacent classes that MIT had to offer. I got to live my dream and write several academic papers on various facets of the gaming world:

                                <p>As a comparative media studies major, I occasionally had to go out into the field to investigate the effect of media on the people around me, and learn to use the data gathered to form research questions and create narratives. As a positive result, I was pushed farther out of my comfort zone than I could have ever gone by myself.

                                <p>As a senior at MIT, I had the great privilege of taking a class with <a href="http://www.junotdiaz.com/">Junot Díaz</a>, which rekindled my long dormant love for creative writing. I would love to do more in the future, and expand upon some of the work I started in this class.

                            <p>I was a design collaborator for the Science+C initiative through the Educational Development Center. I designed a three day data science curriculum for integration into high school biology, chemistry, and physics classes. I ran workshops with educators and iterated using their feedback.

                                <p>The Science+C project is a collaboration between the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to create an alternate pathway to college and science careers for high school students by developing and testing three new computational science courses. These courses—Computational Biology, Computational Chemistry, and Computational Physics—will be available to all Massachusetts high schools beginning in the 2022-2023 school year.</p>

                                <p>I specifically worked as a design collaborator on the Data Science + Machine Learning units. The units were divided into data science, decision trees, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. I designed the data science curriculum, a 3 day workshop with a lesson and associated activities for each day.</p>
